## Introduction
The NFL Draft is a crucial event for teams to secure talent for their rosters. However, not all teams draft equally well, especially when it comes to specific positions. This project aims to shed light on which teams have historically been most successful at drafting players in various positions.

## Dataset
We utilize a comprehensive dataset called nfl_data_py containing historical NFL draft data, including player information such as position, draft round, team selection, and career performance metrics. This dataset enables us to perform in-depth analyses and draw meaningful conclusions about team drafting performance.

## Methodology
Our methodology involves analyzing draft data over multiple seasons to evaluate the drafting success of each NFL team for different positions. We employ statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify trends and patterns in drafting performance.

## Results
The results of our analysis provide insights into which NFL teams have demonstrated superior drafting abilities for specific player positions. These findings can be valuable for teams, analysts, and fans alike in understanding the dynamics of the NFL Draft and assessing team performance.
